# Review finding index — active status map

Authoritative tracker for the **current** review findings. Older review files remain as evidence/history;
this index reflects what is still open against `main`.

- Locked intent: `context/decisions.md` #136 (foundation) + **#137** (C1–C7 contracts) + **#139** (2026-06-22
  correction: the production-safe bar — several #137 "DONE" closures reopened).
- Source reviews:
  - `2026-06-21-post-scrape-foundation-architecture-review.md` (FND-/AND-/REL-/PRIV-/SRV-/OCR-/OPS-)
  - `2026-06-21-scraper-implementation-readiness-review.md` (SCR-)
  - `2026-06-22-full-architecture-design-review.md` (full re-assessment after #119/#120 merged; P0-1..P0-5, P1-1..P1-14)
  - `2026-06-22-research-glm-minimax-review.md` (independent re-analysis of the new GLM/MiniMax answers; no decision changes)
- Status legend: `OPEN` · `WIP` · `PARTIAL` (core landed, contract not fully met) · `REOPEN` (was marked DONE,
  re-opened by a later review) · `DONE` (landed + tested) · `DEFERRED` (gated, not now).

Baseline at index creation: `21fda80`. **Re-assessed against `399ed92` (2026-06-22).** PRs #119/#120 landed the
C1–C7 work at the *blank-rebuild / core-invariant* bar; the 2026-06-22 review applies a *production-safe* bar
and reopens the rows below. Update Status/Evidence as PRs land.

## P0 — must close before ANY scraped canonical write (decision #137)

| ID | Finding (short) | Contract | Status | Closing PR / evidence |
|---|---|---|:--:|---|
| FND-P0-1 / SCR-P0-8 | Stable public id reproducible; numeric→legacy-map; visibility | C1, C3 | DONE (blank rebuild) | #119 — frozen seed UUIDs + `detailByLegacyId` + visibility predicate + `recordOnce` guard. **Verified against blank DB only.** |
| **P0-1 (2026-06-22)** | **Production-row UUID reconciliation** — prod is still pre-V7; deploying V7 assigns *random* UUIDs to the existing 100 rows and the seeder skips them, so a later rebuild yields the *frozen* UUIDs → orphaned clients | C1 | **REOPEN P0** | needs a V11 reconciliation migration + committed `dedup_key→public_id→legacy_id` mapping artifact + upgrade-from-V6 tests + offline rehearsal on a prod-like backup |
| **P0-3 (2026-06-22)** | **Compact tombstone** — `detailByPublicId` returns full `toDetail()` (names/desc/images/provenance) for a `retracted` tea and a broken merge chain, defeating withdrawal of unsafe/unlicensed content | C3 | **WIP (PR #122)** | content-free `TeaLifecycleDto` + sealed `CatalogDetail{Full,Tombstone}`; retracted/broken-chain → 410 Gone; numeric path shares it; tests assert no content leaks |
| AND-P0-1 | v7 Android ref identity must be UUID, not `Long` | C2 | DONE (design) | `context/design/tea-sample-split-v7.md` amendment 2026-06-21; code at v7 impl time |
| FND-P0-2 / SCR-P0-2,3 | Robots/run-ownership/dry-run gates | C4 | **WIP (PR #123)** | #119 closed the exploitable surface; **PR #123 (R3)** adds complete+fresh robots evidence (2xx/hash/url/UA/fetchedAt≤1h), re-registration approval-invalidation, ≤1 active run/source, terminal-immutable `finishRun`, clean status enum + dropped decorative counters (V12). **`allowed_hosts`/URL/redirect/SSRF enforcement folded into FND-P1-4** (same URL-validation family; relevant at fetch time). |
| FND-P0-3 / SCR-P0-4 | Observation revisions stop flowing after first approval | C5 | DONE | branch `harden/scrape-foundation-137-c5c6` — immutable `source_record_revision` (V10), revision-bound decisions, correction flow, stale-approval rejection |
| SCR-P0-5 | Source identity (slug rename / new external id / redirect) not reconciled | C5 | DONE | branch `harden/scrape-foundation-137-c5c6` — slug-rename URL update + `source_record_url_history` + external-id attach + collision detection |
| FND-P0-4 / SCR-P0-6,7 | Value-bearing claims + alias promotion | C6 | **WIP (PR #123)** | #120 landed the claim model; **PR #123 (R4)** adds `type` corroboration/conflict on merge, corroboration claims when sources agree, `brand` as a non-selected proposal (never auto-canonical), and a pessimistic target-tea lock for the selected-claim swap. Remaining nicety: baseline claims for pre-existing curated rows. |
| FND-P0-5 / SCR-P0-9 | Operator HTTP surface unauthenticated when enabled | C7 | DONE | branch `harden/scrape-foundation-137-p0` — removed `IngestReviewController`; local review CLI + route-absence IT |

## P1 — same workstream, before second source / publication scale

| ID | Finding (short) | Status | Closing PR / evidence |
|---|---|:--:|---|
| FND-P1-1 / SCR-P1-1 | Matcher hides ambiguity (`firstOrNull`/single max); ties & multiple authoritative owners not surfaced; can propose an inactive target | PARTIAL | apply-time tombstone guard landed (`InactiveMergeTargetException`, branch `…-c5c6`); ranked candidate set + conflict flags + `status='active'` on the match queries remain (P1 PR) |
| FND-P1-2 / SCR-P1-3 | Vendor/brand semantics: `vendor` ignored; `brand` may land on canonical tea | OPEN | keep vendor on observation; brand only via explicit decision |
| FND-P1-3 / SCR — | Concurrent idempotency constraints + locking | **PARTIAL** | V10 added the unique/partial-unique constraints + the C4 run row-lock. **2026-06-22:** two CLI processes can still load+consume the *same* pending decision — needs `findByIdForUpdate` / atomic `UPDATE … WHERE decision='pending'` / `@Version` on review/apply |
| FND-P1-4 / SCR-P1-2 | Evidence/input validation incomplete; unknown `type`→`OTHER`; country not ISO; region free-text; URL/host/evidence; lenient deserialization; **+ `allowed_hosts` administration + URL/redirect/SSRF (folded from C4/R3)** | **OPEN — P0 before scraper** | strict DTO/schema + URI/host/SSRF validation + `allowed_hosts` enforcement on every observation/evidence URL + ISO-3166 country + #138 region QID queue (or reject region) + persist `raw_evidence` proof chain + re-run facts guard at apply against the exact revision |
| FND-P1-5 | Public lifecycle additive, not integrated (one visibility predicate everywhere) | DONE | folded into C3 (branch `harden/scrape-foundation-137-p0`) |
| AND-P1-1 | Sample/reference split (Room v6→v7), any-language names | **READY** | server prereq exists + amended v7 design; **prod UUID reconciliation (P0-1) must land first.** One doc cleanup: remove the obsolete `Long`-based sketches below the v7 amendment (or move to a labeled historical appendix) before coding |
| AND-P1-2 | Catalog DTO compat not executable (server↔app drift); Android decodes only numeric `id`, ignores lifecycle | OPEN | frozen server/app JSON fixtures in both modules + public-ID routes/lifecycle in contract tests; UUID for all new lookups; numeric compat-only |
| AND-P1-3 (2026-06-22) | Enrichment patch contradicts ownership: `applyEnrichmentPatch` prefers any nonblank catalog value over the user's + always replaces `type` | OPEN | fill blank-only or track per-field dirty/ownership; the v7 ref/sample split is the clean fix; align tests+comments to actual policy |
| AND-P1-4 (2026-06-22) | Queued enrichment not durable — app-coroutine + `resumePending()` on startup; process death/reboot strands work | OPEN | adopt WorkManager 2.11.2 (unique work/sample, network constraint, backoff, idempotent calls) **if** background completion is a product promise, else keep the weaker app-open copy |
| AND-P1-5 (2026-06-22) | Unbounded image/file reads — `readBytes()` before bounds; no byte cap/MIME check on photo copy/import; prefix-based delete; URIs/paths logged in release | OPEN | bounded-stream caps, safe bounds/MIME decode, canonical-path boundary, redact URIs/paths |

## Release / privacy / server / ops — before next public APK (not ingestion-blocking)

| ID | Finding (short) | Status |
|---|---|:--:|
| REL-P0-1 | Release-signing recovery is a single point of failure (operator `release.jks` 0644, no tested recovery) | OPEN (owner) |
| REL-P0-2 | Custom updater trusts server-selected trust data | OPEN |
| REL-P1-1 | `release.yml` not a complete release gate (tag/version/versionCode/package/cert/emulator/SBOM) | OPEN |
| PRIV-P0-1 | Privacy copy/retention vs behavior (geopoints copy, scattered egress, miss-text retention, raw query in `ResolveService` conflict log, diagnostics binds before `@Size`) | OPEN | one data-flow table; cap/normalize+age-purge miss text; redact logs; validate diagnostic body before alloc |
| PRIV-P1-1 (2026-06-22) | Caffeine per-client rate-limit eviction resets abuse budgets | OPEN | add edge/global overload budget + bounded token-bucket; keep expensive-op global semaphores (no Redis at this scale) |
| SRV-P1-1 | LLM activation has unsafe dormant behavior (run 14 reserved) | DEFERRED (no LLM key) |
| SRV-P2-1 | Diagnostics binds oversized body before truncating (`@Valid` + caps) | OPEN |
| OCR-P2-1 | CI/runtime Python version drift (3.12 vs 3.14) | OPEN |
| AND-P2-1 | Offline catalog detail incomplete (cache last detail by UUID) | OPEN |
| AND-P2-2 | Remote catalog images must be first-party / disclosed (no hotlinking) | DEFERRED (no images yet) |
| OPS-P1-1 | Image identity produced but not enforced at deploy; **live prod is behind current migrations/contracts** | **OPEN — urgent** |
| OPS-P1-2 | Backups: broad creds, no enforced restore evidence | OPEN |
| OPS-P1-3 | Single-host: SSH `0.0.0.0/0`, no external alerts, no log rotation | OPEN (owner) |
| OPS-P2-1 | Dependency scan doesn't cover OS/container layers (add Trivy) | OPEN |

## Research ideas (2026-06-22 GLM/MiniMax review) — only 3 worth carrying

The new GLM/MiniMax answers changed no decision (see `2026-06-22-research-glm-minimax-review.md`). Three
genuinely-new ideas survived the strict filter:

| ID | Idea | Touches | Disposition |
|---|---|:--:|---|
| RES-1 | Curated ~300-term tea glossary (Хун, Гунфу, Да Хун Пао…) to guard the dict-gated OCR corrector from mangling domain terms | #123 OCR correction | **ADOPT** — pre-commit before OCR-correction Phase 1 ships (low cost) |
| RES-2 | MiniMax `scrape_upsert_canonical()` plpgsql as a reference sketch for source-record-keyed upsert | #136/#137 | **SPIKE only** — reconcile with the locked dedup arch (pypinyin + pg_trgm @0.3) before any use |
| RES-3 | Hilt provider scaffolding for map providers (`@Provides` + named list, configurable style URL) | #9 map abstraction | **ADOPT as reference** when map work resumes post-MVP (M6); not in scope now |

## Scraper module (SCR-P0-1) — deferred until the "ready for scraper" gate is met

> Gate = `2026-06-22-full-architecture-design-review.md` §"Definition of ready for scraper": deterministic
> rehearsed prod UUIDs; source-change approval invalidation + enforced hosts/redirects; fresh run-bound
> robots/ToS evidence; locked apply-authorized run state + immutable terminals; no dry/unreviewed/stale
> write; type/country/region cannot coerce to free text; ambiguity returns candidates; every canonical
> field has a reviewed claim; retraction removes content but keeps identity; idempotent rerun + withdrawal.


| ID | Finding | Status |
|---|---|:--:|
| SCR-P0-1 | No executable scraper boundary (module/lockfile/fetch/parser/fixtures) | DEFERRED — "the next deliverable is not a crawler" |
| SCR-P1-4 | One canonical row can't express unresolved field conflicts | DEFERRED (needs value-bearing claims = C6 first) |
| SCR-P1-5 | Stored normalization hints diagnostic only; PostgreSQL owns match normalization | NOTED (already correct in code; preserve) |
